           This is my capstone project from my time with <%= link_to "Bloc.io",
           "https://www.bloc.io", :target => "_blank" %>. This is an ongoing project for
           trying new things both as developer and a creator of something new. I have always
           been interested in how we communicate with one another due to both the amazing
           ways we can share ideas and all of the interesting ways we seem to muck it up.
           This project sprung from the desire to capture the romantic notion of the classic
           correspondence. What happens when the permanence of a post is explicit and cannot
           be edited? Or if two people can carry on a conversation without the influence of
           a constant barrage of comments, and share it when they choose?

           My second project with <%= link_to "Bloc.io", "https://www.bloc.io",
           :target => "_blank" %>.
           This is where things started to click for me.
           I was able to implement more new ideas than on my first project due to a
           better understanding of the big picture. ActiveRecord, model relationships,
           controller actions, views, you name it. The project site itself is bare bones
           function focused and demonstrates my struggles with front end design, but my
           personal highlights include working with a joins table, policy with pundit,
           and really getting to know the ActiveRecord Relationships that Rails can
           obfuscate on basic projects.

           My first project. A self destructing to do list.
           Not much to look at, but my first foray without an explicit blueprint to follow.
           Even so, most of the code is focused on using the small
           set of familiar concepts I had at the time. Already looking back, I can see where
           I shoehorned some code for a task that I simply didnâ€™t know a better way to do yet,
           or my clunky understanding of routes and model relationships. We all start somewhere,
           and I share with you my humblest beginnings.
